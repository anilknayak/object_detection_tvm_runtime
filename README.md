This is an open source project for face analysis and object detection using Deep Learning techniques.
Which used TVM and NNVM as compiler and runtime.

This project also demonstrates following aspect deep learning and C++ tech stack.
1. cmake configuration for build c++ project
2. tensorflow for training face analysis and object detection model
3. deploy deep learning model using tvm runtime and optimize the computation


# Face Analysis C++ API


# Object Detection and Recognition C++ API
